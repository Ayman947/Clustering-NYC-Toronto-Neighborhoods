# Clustering-NYC-Toronto-Neighborhoods

> This project approaches a commonly faced problem by people who have to **move** from **NYC** to **Toronto** or Vice versa.

> The problem they face is that they have to move yet they prefer to move to a **similar place** to where they were, having the same **lifestyle**. (ex: similar places, similar venues, ...etc.)

> So, we **clustered the neighborhoods** within the two cities according to their most common **venues**.

> Having clustered them, people will be able to **identify easily where to go** as simple as looking at the **clustered neighborhoods map** which has been generated and identify simmilar neighborhoods by **colors**.
